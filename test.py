"""
This file is used to test the basic functions of the EightPuzzle class 
using unit tests and pytest. This file is not proof of algorithmic 
effectiveness for the searches, it does however provide evidence for 
the class working in the intended way. This file proves the efficacy of 
the basic EightPuzzle class functions. It also proves the correctness 
of the heuristic functions that are used in the searches.
